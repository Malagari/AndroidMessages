# Android Messages
A Chrome-backed desktop application for Android Messages, similar to iMessage.

# Prerequisites
* Android Phone
* Android Messages as the main SMS app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging&hl=en_US)
* Google Chrome

# Installation
1. Pack the _src_ folder yourself, or download the prebuilt _.crx_.
2. In Google Chrome, go to Settings - More Tools - Extensions.
3. Toggle Developer Mode on (in the top right corner of the Extensions screen).
4. Drag-and-drop the _.crx_ file onto the browser window.  This will prompt you to install the application.  Once installed, the application will show up in the Chrome App Launcher.
5. Right-click the app in the Chrome App Launcher, and select Create Shortcut.  This shortcut can be added to the _Applications_ folder on macOS for easy Spotlight access, or anywhere on Windows.
6. Launch the application, and follow the instructions to pair it with your phone.
